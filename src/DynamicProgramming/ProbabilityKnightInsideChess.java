     * Given an NxN chessboard and a Knight at position (x,y).
     * The Knight has to take exactly K steps, where at each step it chooses any of the 8 directions uniformly at
     * random. What is the probability that the Knight remains in the chessboard after taking K steps,
     * with the condition that it canâ€™t enter the board again once it leaves it.
     *
     * Examples:
     *
     * Let's take:
     * 8x8 chessboard,
     * initial position of the knight : (0, 0),
     * number of steps : 1
     * At each step, the Knight has 8 different positions to choose from.
     *
     * If it starts from (0, 0), after taking one step it will lie inside the
     * board only at 2 out of 8 positions, and will lie outside at other positions.
     * So, the probability is 2/8 = 0.25
     *
     * Solution :
     * N is size of the board
     * start_x,start_y are the starting positions
     * steps are the number of steps it would take
     *
     * DP bottom case
     * when steps =0
     * Probability of knight inside chess is 1 at each block
