     * Minimum time required to rot all oranges
     *
     * Given a matrix of dimension m*n where each cell in the matrix can have values 0, 1 or 2 which has the following
     * meaning:
     *
     * 0: Empty cell
     *
     * 1: Cells have fresh oranges
     *
     * 2: Cells have rotten oranges
     * So we have to determine what is the minimum time required so that all the oranges become rotten.
     * A rotten orange at index [i,j] can rot other fresh orange at indexes [i-1,j], [i+1,j], [i,j-1], [i,j+1]
     * (up, down, left and right). If it is impossible to rot every orange then simply return -1.
     *
     * Examples:
     *
     * Input:  arr[][C] = { {2, 1, 0, 2, 1},
     *                      {1, 0, 1, 2, 1},
     *                      {1, 0, 0, 2, 1}};
     * Output:
     * All oranges can become rotten in 2 time frames.
     *
     *
     * Input:  arr[][C] = { {2, 1, 0, 2, 1},
     *                      {0, 0, 1, 2, 1},
     *                      {1, 0, 0, 2, 1}};
     * Output:
     * All oranges cannot be rotten.

     * Solution :
     *
     * The solution of this problem is similar to BFS (or level order traversal of Binary Tree).
     * We use a Queue data structure and insert cell in queue.
     * The structure that gets stored in the queue (the data part of queue) is
     *
     * class DataElement
     * {
     *     int i;
     *     int j;
     *     int time;
     * };
     * The time in this structure is the time at which orange in this cell will rot.
     * Initially time is zero and all the cells with rotten oranges are inserted in the Queue (with their time as zero)
     * After the the below algorithm is used
     *
     * WHILE (Queue is not empty)
     *   Remove cell from Queue and check all the nearby cells of this removed cell.
     *      IF the nearby cell has Fresh orange
     *          Insert it in the Queue with time = time of removed cell +1
     * Time of the last cell removed from the queue represent the time to rot all oranges in the queue.
     * After this loop we also need to check if there is some cell in the matrix that still has 1.
     * If such cell is present, then this cell is not reachable from any of the rotten orangeâ€™s cell.
     * In this case we need to return -1.
